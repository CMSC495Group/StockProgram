Goal

          The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict future prices of technology stocks.

Requirements Specification

          Historical data will be pulled from an internet source and stored inside of a database. From there, 
          the user will be able to select a company stock ticker from a given list. The user will be shown historical chart data, the most recent news, and a prediction of a price in the near future.

System Specifications

            Hardware specifications involve a standard PC. The project will most likely be coded in Python. However, this has not been fully decided. If so, software specifications will require Python be installed with all required modules. Other languages in mind are Java and C++. Java will require a recent version of JDK.
